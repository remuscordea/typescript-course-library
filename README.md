# A Node.js Course Library API System

This **Node.js** project is focused on building a **REST API** designed to manage courses within a library setting. Developed entirely in **Typescript**, the API leverages the **TypeORM** framework to facilitate seamless interaction between the application logic and a **PostgreSQL** database.

In addition to supporting basic **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks, the API includes robust features such as a **JWT**-based authentication system and middleware integration. While certain endpoints are accessible to the public, others necessitate authentication via a registered account.
